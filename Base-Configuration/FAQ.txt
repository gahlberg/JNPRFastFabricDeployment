Frequently Asked Questions
Q: Why does it take 3 minutes to bring up the fabric?
A: In the configuration example, there are some default values that we change and in doing so the PFE must be rebooted. These values allow me to scale up the test clients quite a bit.

Q: If I took out the system change commands, how long would it take to bring up the network?
A: Less than 90 Seconds. If this was a production network, you would never set this more than once.
